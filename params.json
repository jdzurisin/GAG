Can write files to .gff3 or to the NCBI's .tbl format.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Example Usage\r\nIn this exciting vignette, you will create a .tbl file from the .fasta and .gff files provided in the 'walkthrough' directory. You should run these commands from within the main GAG directory, or else adjust the file paths.\r\n\r\n####Run program\r\n    python console.py\r\n\r\n####Read in data\r\n    GAG> loadfolder walkthrough\r\n\r\n####Write .tbl file \r\n    GAG> writetbl foo.tbl\r\n\r\n####Go on your merry way\r\n    GAG> exit\r\n\r\nWith any luck, you now have a file in your working directory called 'foo.tbl'. There may be any number of things wrong with it -- please get in touch with us so we can fix whatever ridiculous errors we have made. We're all in this together :)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
